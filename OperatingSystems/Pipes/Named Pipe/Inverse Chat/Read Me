Note: Execute first "CreateNamedPipes.c" to create two pipe and comunicate our programs.

1.- Execute in a shell FirstUser.c.
2.- Open a different shell and re-name the process ( exameple: gcc SecondUser.c -o Second && ./Second ).
3.- Send messages from the shell of FirstUser.c.

This program creates two different processes, those process create each one two threads, those threads are connected by 
the pipes created before, from FirstUser.c shell you can write message and SecondUser.c will receive those message, will 
inverst the string ( message ) and will re-send it to "FirstUser.c" shell, in the output standard you will ve able to see the interaction 
between this 2 processes.

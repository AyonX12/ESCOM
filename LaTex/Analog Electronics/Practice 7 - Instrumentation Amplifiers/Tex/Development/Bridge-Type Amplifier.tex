\subsection{Bridge-Type Amplifier:}

In Figure 3.1.0 it's presented the differential instrumentation amplifier, after we assembled this circuit, we adjust the output voltage $V_{o}$ to zero volts with the preset help. As we can see we are using a {\itshape thermistor}, this device must be in ambient temperature, the measures consist in:

\begin{itemize}
\item Measure the output voltage with the {\itshape thermistor} in ambient temperature.
\item Measure the output voltage pressing with your fingers the {\itshape thermistor} to make it variate its temperature.
\item Measure the output voltage by putting very close to the {\itshape htermistor} lighter.
\end{itemize} \hfill

After measuring this output voltages, we capture our results in Table 1. \hfill \break

\section{Development:}

We are going to analyze several circuits with four different transistors. 

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries\itshape 2N2222A Transistor.}
\item {\bfseries\itshape BC547C Transistor.}
\item {\bfseries\itshape BC557C Transistor.}
\item {\bfseries\itshape TIP41 Transistor.}
\end{itemize}

And visualize the cutoff and saturation points of each one.

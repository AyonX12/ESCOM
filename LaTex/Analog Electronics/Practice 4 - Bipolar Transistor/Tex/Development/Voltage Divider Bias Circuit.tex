\subsection{Voltage Divider Bias Circuit:}

For the following experiment we assemble the circuit in Figure 3.2.0. The procedure consist in exchange between two {\bfseries\itshape NPN} transistors ( {\bfseries\itshape 2N2222A} and {\bfseries\itshape BC547C} ) and compare in Table 2 the measured values. \hfill \break

Once we had the circuit, we proceed to measure $V_{B}$, $V_{C}$, $V_{CE}$, $I_{B}$, $I_{C}$, $I_{E}$: \hfill \break

\begin{tasks}
\task For $V_{B}$: The Base Voltage can be measured by connecting the positive terminal of the voltmeter on the {\bfseries\itshape Base} terminal of the transistor, and the negative terminal of the voltmeter on the {\bfseries\itshape Ground} reference.
\task For $V_{C}$: The Collector Voltage can be measured by connecting the positive terminal of the voltmeter on the {\bfseries\itshape Collector} terminal of the transistor, and the negative terminal of the voltmeter on the {\bfseries\itshape Ground} reference.
\task For $V_{CE}$: The Emitter-Collector Voltage can be measured by connecting the positive terminal of the voltmeter on the {\bfseries\itshape Collector} terminal, and the negative terminal of the voltmeter on the {\bfseries\itshape Emitter} terminal.
\task For $I_{B}$: The Base current can be measured by connecting the ammeter in series with the node that connects {\bfseries\itshape $R_{1}$} and {\bfseries\itshape $R_{2}$} and the {\bfseries\itshape Base} terminal of the transistor.
\task For $I_{C}$: The Collector current can be measured by connecting the ammeter in series with {\bfseries\itshape $R_{C}$} and the {\bfseries\itshape Collector} terminal of the transistor.
\task For $I_{E}$: The Emitter current can be measured by connecting the ammeter in series with {\bfseries\itshape $R_{E}$} and the {\bfseries\itshape Emitter} terminal of the transistor.

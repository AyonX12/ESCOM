\section{Conclusion:}

The transistor, as far, are the most complicated and important device that we think, we analyze in this course, this because, they have a lot of applications and 3 different configuration for a so tiny and simple device. Its functionality it's based on the diode principle and we have seen and demonstrated that the {\bfseries\itshape Common - Base} configuration has the particularity of increment in potential the output voltage, power, and resistance but not the current. As well, for the {\bfseries\itshape Common - Emitter} configuration it's very effective for increasing current, voltage, resistance and of course, power. Finally, the {\bfseries\itshape Common - Collector} configuration increase current, but not the voltage. As well, we also analyze how to convert from a {\bfseries\itshape Basic Polarization Circuit} to a {\bfseries\itshape Voltage Divider Bias Circuit} and vice versa. Seen a little applications for the transistor was a very interesting part of the practice, we also read about the {\bfseries\itshape H-Bridge} that has a lot of applications in the industry and its configuration it's based in transistor.

\section{Conclusions:}

We discussed the purpose of a rectifier circuit as well as two specific types of rectifiers: the half-wave rectifier and the full-wave rectifier. Rectifiers are essential circuits for power supplies that convert an AC input voltage into a DC voltage supply that can be used to power electronic circuits. We saw that the half-wave rectifier utilizes alternate half-cycles of the input sine wave whereas the full-wave rectifier utilizes both positive and negative half-cycles. The rectifiers are the principle of the {\bfseries\itshape voltage sources}. With the capacitor we see that the signal it's more smoother, but we can get better results if we add after the capacitor a regulator to keep in our source a "constant" voltage, so that the {\bfseries\itshape ripple} voltage always be fewer than 100mV. \hfill \break

So the we cannot measure the simulated values for the {\bfseries ripple voltage} or the {\bfseries peak voltage} of the circuits. In case of being necessary, we can show to the professor our simulations to probe that the software don't run the it.}}

\section{Theoretical Analysis:}

For each one of the circuits showed in the section {\bfseries\itshape Development}, a corresponding Theoretic Analysis was made, calculating the Voltage and Current in the resistor $R_{L}$, as well the Peak-Voltage $V_{p}$ and if it's required, the Ripple-Voltage ( $\Delta V$ ).

\section{Development:}

We are going to analyze several circuits, with different resistors and capacitors, to visualize how the {\bfseries\itshape half-wave} and {\bfseries\itshape full-wave} rectification looks in physical circuits and with the help of an oscilloscope we are going to capture the form of the output signal after being rectified. Theoretically, this signal must be CC.

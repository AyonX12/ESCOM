\subsection{Transformer:}

After rectified the signal, we assembly the circuit of the Figure 3.1.0, the transformer to be used it's of {\bfseries\itshape 12$V_{rms}$ to 1A} this means that in the {\bfseries\itshape secondary winding} the voltage will be approximately of 12$V_{rms}$. The {\bfseries\itshape primary winding} will be connected to the outlet plug and the voltage that will be driving will be approximately of 117$V_{rms}$. \hfill \break

We are going to be switching between two resistors: One of 100$\Omega$ at 10W and the other one of 22$\Omega$ at 25W. For each resistor, the voltage will be measured, and the result its going to be registered in the table bellow. \hfill \break

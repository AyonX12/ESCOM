\section{Conclusions:}

The voltage regulators have a multiple functions in the industry as in our daily life, a lot of devices that we use every day, internally could implement one of the methods of regulation that we have analyze in this practice, this, with the purpose of protect our devices. In general, it was a interesting thing to visualize the functionality of the zener diode, because in class it's a bit difficult to figure or imagine whats the zener knee and why the voltage in this region act like it was fixed. As and alternative, if we don't want to use a zener diode, we have a IC series that regulate voltage, in this practice we use the LM7805 and LM7812 for positive fixed regulations, as well the LM7905 and LM7912 as negative fixed regulation.

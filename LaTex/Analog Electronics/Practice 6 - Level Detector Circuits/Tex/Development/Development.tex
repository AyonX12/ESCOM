\section{Development:}

We are going to analyze the circuits presented in section 2 implementing an op-amp {\bfseries TL071} with a 12 V source. \hfill \break

{\bfseries\itshape\color{carmine}{Observation:}} {\itshape\color{carmine}{For all the circuits we need a positive and negative voltage source in terminals 7 and 4 of the op-amp respectively. In the sources, we choose the option {\bfseries SERIES} and connect both $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ in series by connecting the negative terminal of $E_{1}$ to the positive terminal of $E_{2}$, this "new" terminal will be connected to the common ground, thus, the positive terminal of $E_{1}$ and the negative terminal of $E_{2}$ will be the positive and negative voltages respectively.}}

\subsection{Voltage Level Detector Applications:}

Once the circuit in Figure 3.4.0 were assembled, we start to increase and decrease the potentiometer resistance to visualize what does this circuit do. And, depending of the voltage level in $V_{i}$ the LED's start to turn on, this because the voltage divider of 1 K $\Omega$ resistors and the implementation of the Level Detectors. When each LED went on, we measure the voltage in $V_{i}$ and registered the results in Table 1.

Once the circuit in Figure 3.4.1 were assembled, we start to increase and decrease the potentiometer resistance to visualize what does this circuit do. Finally we set the potentioner when the bulb started to "flash", in other words; When the bulb weren't to brighter but neither to dimmer. We were able to visualize that if the photocell were receiving light, then the bulb turned off; when the photocell weren't receiving light the bulb turned on. Then, we registered the result in table 2.

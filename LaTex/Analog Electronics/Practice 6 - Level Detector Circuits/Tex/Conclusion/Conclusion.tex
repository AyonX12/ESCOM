\section{Conclusion:}

The amplifiers, as far, are the most complicated and important device that we think, we analyze in this course, this because, they have a lot of applications and different configuration for a so tiny and simple device. Its functionality it's based on the transistor principle and we have seen and demonstrated that depending of the devices that we connect around of the amplifier it will do a specified operation as a addition, product, subtraction, integration, derivation, inclusive the Fourier Transform. This device has a lot of applications in the industry and in out daily life. Also, the positive and negative inputs can be used to have a level detector by using this voltage as saturation $V_{sat}$. In every new class we discover that this device has more and more configurations and applications, like the one with hysteresis voltage by feedback the non-inverting input with the $V_{sal}$ output.

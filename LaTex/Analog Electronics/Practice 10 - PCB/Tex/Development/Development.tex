\section{Development:}

After starting the etching process to make our circuit board we need to cut the copper plate at the size of the {\itshape layout}. In our case we needed of {\itshape 10mm} of height per {\itshape  6mm} of width approximately. So, using the cutter we {\itshape mark} the copper plate several times like in Figure 3.0 until the copper plate split easily ( Figure 3.1 ). The we can start the etching process. \hfill \break

\section{Conclusion:}

It's very important to understand sorting algorithms. I think that there is not really a reason for implementing my own sorting algorithm from scratch for a production application. However in this course I have discovered advanced facets of a language along with programming design patterns that have given me an edge as a developer. In addition to combining multiple language components, sorting algorithms also had helped me to understand program accuracy and speed, because, just like in any type of program, sorting algorithms are not valid unless they are accurate. This algorithms give an abstract way of studying program accuracy and performance.

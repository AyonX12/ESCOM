\subsection{Test 4:}

For the same graph of Figure 4.3.0, we will analyze the certificate {\itshape C = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 1 ]}, as we can see clearly, this isn't a {\bfseries Hamiltonial-Cycle} because has a repeated vertex which it's the node 7, so, the program will stop analyzing and will only print on the console output ( Figure 4.4.0 ) that the certificate isn't a {\bfseries Hamiltonial-Cycle}. \hfill \break

              7: [ 6, 2, 8 ], 8: [ 7, 5, 1 ] }
    certificate = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 1 ]

\section{Conclusion:}

In this occasion we observed that not all problems that can be easily checked are so trivial to solve, a problem can have a verifiable solution in polynomial time but it does not mean that this solution has been reached in polynomial time, how is it possible that can that be done ?, the reason is because they are complete np, they are those that are verified polynomially but their solution is not in the same time, however there are some problems that besides being verifiable in polynomial time, have a solution in time polynomial, which tells us this, that the problems that most concern us are those that are in this range. \hfill \break

A good engineer in computer science should be able to distinguish between this type of problems easily, the problems p, np, np-complete and np-hard should be attacked and differentiated in order to know at what moment the resolution of a problem would be implosible. conflict, how can improve response times and also have a set of viable solutions for a certain occasion, not necessarily the best time is the algorithm that can help us meet our needs.

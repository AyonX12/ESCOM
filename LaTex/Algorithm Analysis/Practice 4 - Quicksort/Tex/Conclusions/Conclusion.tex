\section{Conclusion:}

I never realize the importance of the {\bfseries\itshape divide-and-conquer} paradigm, I realize that maybe I applied it many times, but never take conscience what I was really doing, an example it's the {\bfseries\itshape Bubble-Sort}, this algorithm was maybe the first that I programmed, but up to this point, I didn't know that uses this paradigm. Now, I'm quite intrigued what other applications will have {\bfseries\itshape divide-and-conquer}.

This time we could use the algorithms properties to demonstrate the complexity of some algorithms, we increase in complexity about the programming task, for instance, the programming level was a bit interesting. The new issue was the $log$ complexity about the algorithm, I think this time the algorithm was very useful than other many programs that we were analyzing, because a lot of programs needs to sort their data or collections.

\subsection{Gb.py}

This module only stores the global variables that we are going to use:

\begin{tasks}
\task {\bfseries\itshape $\_$parameters:} List that store the parameters of the points to plot for Partition. Each element it's a tuple that stores the length of the sorted list, and the time that the algorithm took to execute its process the first time it was called.
\task {\bfseries\itshape parameters:} List that store the parameters of the points to plot for Quicksort. Each element it's a tuple that stores the length of the sorted list, and the time that the algorithm takes to sort it.
\task {\bfseries\itshape $\_$time:} Counter that stores the computational time that the algorithm Partition takes to finish his execution process.
\task {\bfseries\itshape time:} Counter that stores the computational time that the algorithm Quicksort takes to sort the list 'n'.
\task {\bfseries\itshape flag:} Flag used in graph.py, help to create the labels of the proposed function, depending if the user select worst or random case.
\task {\bfseries\itshape n:} List to sort.
\end{tasks}

\section{Development:}

Based on the divide-and-conquer procedure explained in section 2.2, in the following sections we will formally demonstrate the temporal complexity of the algorithms {\bfseries\itshape Quicksort} and {\bfseries\itshape Partition}, as well, we will explain our implemented code. \hfill \break

I divided the program in 6 python modules, to have a better control of the code.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries\itshape main.py:} Control the sequence of execution.
\item {\bfseries\itshape menu.py:} Creates the list {\bfseries A} to sort of length 'n', entered by the user in console.
\item {\bfseries\itshape quicksort.py:} Principal algorithm, split the list {\bfseries A} several times. This algorithm implements the divide-and-conquer paradigm.
\item {\bfseries\itshape partition.py:} Secondary algorithm, sort the list {\bfseries A}.
\item {\bfseries\itshape graph.py:} Plot the computational time of 'quicksort.py' and 'partition.py'
\item {\bfseries\itshape gb.py:} Store the global variables to use.
\end{itemize}

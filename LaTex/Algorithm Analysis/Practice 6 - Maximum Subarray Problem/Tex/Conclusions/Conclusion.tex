\section{Conclusion:}

I never realize the importance of the {\bfseries\itshape divide-and-conquer} paradigm, I realize that maybe I applied it many times, but never take conscience what I was really doing, an example it's the {\bfseries\itshape Binary-Search}, this algorithm was maybe the first that I programmed, but up to this point, I didn't know that uses this paradigm. Now, I'm quite intrigued what other applications will have {\bfseries\itshape divide-and-conquer}. It's important to remark that in this practice the implementation of divide-and-conquer paradigm solve the maximum subarray problem in linear o $n \cdot log_{2}\ (n)$ time, which it's better than the iterative in an square time.

This time we could use the algorithms properties to demonstrate the complexity of some algorithms, we increase in complexity about the programming task, for instance, the programming level was a bit interesting. The new issue was the recursion of the algorithm, I think this time the algorithm was very useful than other many programs that we were analyzing.

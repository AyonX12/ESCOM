\section{Results:}

All the code shown above doesn't have significance if its operation is not shown. This section will show you the {\bfseries\itshape console} output and the graphic of the temporal complexity of the algorithms previously mentioned. Also, I attach a table with the plot points for each test. \hfill \break

{\bfseries\itshape\color{carmine}{Observation:}} {\itshape\color{carmine}{From this point in each plot figure that we were analyzing the left plot will correspond to the {\bfseries Brute-Force} algorithm, the plot of the center to the {\bfseries Crossing Subarray} algorithm and the right one to the {\bfseries Recursive Maximum Subarray} algorithm.}} \hfill \break

{\bfseries\itshape\color{carmine}{Observation:}} {\itshape\color{carmine}{From this point in each plot figure that we were analyzing the black pointed functions will be the asymptotic proposed ones, where for the left plot it's {\bfseries g ( n ) = $\frac{10}{8} \cdot n^{2}$}, for the center will be {\bfseries h ( n ) = $\frac{10}{8}$ n} and for the right plot will be {\bfseries s ( n ) = $\frac{10}{8} \cdot n \cdot log_{2} ( n )$}.}}

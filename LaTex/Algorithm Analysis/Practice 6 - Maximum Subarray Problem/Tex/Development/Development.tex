\section{Development:}

In this section we will implement the {\bfseries Maximum Subarray} algorithms. We divided the program in 4 python modules to have a better control of the code.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries\itshape main.py:} Control the sequence of execution.
\item {\bfseries\itshape maximum$\_$subarray.py:} This module implements the 3 different algorithms to find a solution to the {\itshape Maximum Subarray} problem.
\item {\bfseries\itshape plot.py:} Plot the computational time of the algorithms.
\item {\bfseries\itshape global$\_$variables.py:} As the name of the module, stores the global variables of the program.
\end{itemize}

{\bfseries\itshape\color{carmine}{Observation:}} {\itshape\color{carmine}{The code that we will show bellow doesn't include the counter in each line of the algorithm, this because to make notice only the essential parts. For that, see subsection 3.4.}}

\subsection{Positive Ordered Integers Array:}

The first test will consist in evaluate the running time of the algorithms analyzing an array of ordered integers of size $2^{10}$. \hfill \break

{\bfseries\itshape\color{carmine}{Observation:}} {\itshape\color{carmine}{Since the size it's $2^{10}$ the parameters of the points of each algorithm are to many, so we decide to not attach only for this case the table of mapping values and the console output.}} \hfill \break

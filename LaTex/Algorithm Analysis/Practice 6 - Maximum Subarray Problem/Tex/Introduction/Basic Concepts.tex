\section{Basic Concepts:}

The {\bfseries\itshape Strassen's} algorithm, implements the divide-and-conquer paradigm.

\subsection{Divide-and-Conquer Paradigm:}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm involves three steps at each level of the recursion:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries\itshape Divide:} Divide the problem into a number of sub-problems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
\item {\bfseries\itshape Conquer:} Conquer the sub-problems by solving them recursively. If the sub-problem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the sub-problems in a straightforward manner.
\item {\bfseries\itshape Combine:} Combine the solutions to the sub-problems into the solution for the original problem.
\end{itemize}

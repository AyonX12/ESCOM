\subsection{Matrix$\_$operations.py}

This module has 2 methods: 

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries add ( ... )}.
\item {\bfseries subtract ( ... )}.
\end{itemize} 

Each method realize a very simply operation, {\bfseries add ( A, B )} as its name says, add/sum the matrices {\bfseries A} and {\bfseries B} and {\bfseries subtract ( A, B )}, subtract both matrices and both methods return the resulting matrix {\bfseries C}.  \hfill \break

\begin{lstlisting}
def add ( A, B ):
    n = len ( A )
    C = [ [ A [ i ] [ j ] + B [ i ] [ j ] for j in range ( n ) ] for i in range ( n ) ]
    # Return statement.
    return C

def subtract ( A, B ):
    n = len ( A )
    C = [ [ A [ i ] [ j ] - B [ i ] [ j ] for j in range ( n ) ] for i in range ( n ) ]
    # Return statement.
    return C
\end{lstlisting}

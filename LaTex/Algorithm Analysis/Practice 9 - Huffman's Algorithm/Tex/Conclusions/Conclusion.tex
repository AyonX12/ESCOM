\section{Conclusion:}

It's a very interesting thing to see a Greedy algorithm in action. This time we had the opportunity to program the {\bfseries Huffman's algorithm} that it's very useful to compress bigger files into a smaller ones saving between a 20 $\%$ and 90 $\%$ efficiently. This allow us to had an idea how compression programs like {\itshape winrar} works.

\subsection{Decode:}

As we have explained above, when the encoding process it's finished we store in our file system some archives, among them we can be able to find the dictionary of codes {\bfseries Dictionary.dic} and the encoded text in {\bfseries Encoded File.txt}. So, for decoding we need to charge this two files to the program {\bfseries Decoder} already provided, and complete the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Read bit by bit and see if the string it's on the dictionary.
\item If the string it's on the dictionary, replace it with its respectively {\itshape symbol}.
\item Repeat the times that it's necessary.
\end{enumerate}

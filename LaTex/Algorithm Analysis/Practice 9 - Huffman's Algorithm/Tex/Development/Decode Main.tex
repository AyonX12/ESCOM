\subsubsection{Setting All Together:}

Finally we can make the respectively methods call in the order previously explained, this work it's executed by the {\bfseries main} method. As we can see in the code bellow, in line 2 we get the parameters for the decompression and in line 3 we make the call to the method decode that returns the input text decoded. Finally, in lines 4 - 5 we store the decoded text in a file with the name "Decoded File.txt". \hfill \break

\begin{lstlisting}
def main ( ):
    compressed, dictionary = getParameters ( )
    decompressed = decode ( dictionary, compressed )
    with ( open ( "Files/Decoded File.txt", "w" ) ) as f:
        f.write ( decompressed )
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Conclusion:}

Maybe the first dynamic algorithm program that I ever have seen in all my computing career. It's very interesting to see that if we have a chain of matrices, depending on how we associate to multiply them, it will result in an optimal or not configuration. Dynamic programming works particularly well for optimization problems with inherent left to right ordering among elements. The resulting global optimum often much better than solution found with heuristics. And once understood, dynamic programming is usually easier to work algorithm out from scratch than to look up algorithm.

Description: This module only stores the global variables of the program:

        parameters_1: List that stores the parameters of the points to plot
                      for the Best case of the selected Algorithm. Each
                      element it's a tuple that stores the size of the Array
                      and the temporal complexity in its first and second
                      element respectively.

        parameters_2: List that stores the parameters of the points to plot
                      for the Random case of the selected Algorithm. Each
                      element it's a tuple that stores the size of the Array
                      and the temporal complexity in its first and second
                      element respectively.

        parameters_3: List that stores the parameters of the points to plot
                      for the Worst case of the selected Algorithm. Each
                      element it's a tuple that stores the size of the Array
                      and the temporal complexity in its first and second
                      element respectively.

        time: Variable that stores the temporal complexity of each algorithm.
